Before couple of months I had to implement a backend component with GraphQL in Golang, what got me confused at first is that sometimes your API needs are to return a JSON object according to a custom query. The problems becomes more clear when I understood that in GraphQL we need to define our API types as scalars (boolean, bnumber, string) , list or enums or we have to define custom types but after all they have to return simple scalars. So according to those rules, how can we introduce the JSON type?"),Object(a.b)("p",null,"Let\u2019s take a look at the following Golang snippet:"),Object(a.b)("pre",null,Object(a.b)("code",r({parentName:"pre"},{className:"language-go"}),'import (\n    "fmt"\n\n    "github.com/graphql-go/graphql"\n    "github.com/graphql-go/graphql/language/ast"\n    "github.com/graphql-go/graphql/language/kinds"\n)\n\nfunc parseLiteral(astValue ast.Value) interface{} {\n    kind := astValue.GetKind()\n\n    switch kind {\n    case kinds.StringValue:\n        return astValue.GetValue()\n    case kinds.BooleanValue:\n        return astValue.GetValue()\n    case kinds.IntValue:\n        return astValue.GetValue()\n    case kinds.FloatValue:\n        return astValue.GetValue()\n    case kinds.ObjectValue:\n        obj := make(map[string]interface{})\n        for _, v := range astValue.GetValue().([]*ast.ObjectField) {\n            obj[v.Name.Value] = parseLiteral(v.Value)\n        }\n        return obj\n    case kinds.ListValue:\n        list := make([]interface{}, 0)\n        for _, v := range astValue.GetValue().([]ast.Value) {\n            list = append(list, parseLiteral(v))\n        }\n        return list\n    default:\n        return nil\n    }\n}\n\n// JSON json type\nvar JSON = graphql.NewScalar(\n    graphql.ScalarConfig{\n        Name:        "JSON",\n        Description: "The `JSON` scalar type represents JSON values as specified by [ECMA-404](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf)",\n        Serialize: func(value interface{}) interface{} {\n            return value\n        },\n        ParseValue: func(value interface{}) interface{} {\n            return value\n        },\n        ParseLiteral: parseLiteral,\n    },\n)\n')),Object(a.b)("p",null,"As we can see, we introduced a new scalar type which on parseLiteral hook calls the parseLiteral function.
